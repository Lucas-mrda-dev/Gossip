#Gossip Board (Sinatra + ERB + CSV)
A small Sinatra + ERB + CSV gossip board where you can create, list, and view gossips (author, content).

##What’s inside 
Stack: Sinatra + ERB, CSV persistence
Domain: Gossip encapsulates author / content; save writes, all reads all
Features: list, form, create, detail
Views: index, new_gossip, show
Flow: form → save → CSV → redirect → list

##How to launch
bundle install
ruby app.rb (or: rackup -p 4567)
then open: http://localhost:4567/

##Endpoints
GET / → home page: list of gossips + “Create a gossip” link
GET /gossips/new/ → renders the creation form
POST /gossips/new/ → saves author and content to CSV
GET /gossips/:id/ → shows gossip #:id (1 = first, 2 = second, …)
If the ID is out of range → “Gossip not found”

##Tips & pitfalls
locals vs @variables: index.erb receives gossips via locals
CSV append: open with 'ab' to add without overwriting
Route order: define GET /gossips/new/ before GET /gossips/:id/ so :id doesn’t capture "new"
Form params: keys come from name= attributes (gossip_author, gossip_content)
